# Valorant Agent Randomizer
### Introduction
I play valorant quite often. Sometimes when I play replication I am unable to 
decide which agent I want to play. For that I used to use a random number generator,
but the problem with it is I have to count from 1 to 19 which agent was selected
by the randomizer. It was quite a tedious task. So I decided to make an app to
solve that problem with some extra quality of life features. I will try to make
it better over time by keeping it up to date and fixing any bugs that I notice
 or are brought to my attention.
